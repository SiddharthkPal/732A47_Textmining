We are aware of this and are working with Google to address the issue.2) While you can use your existing Smule account with Magic Piano on Android, the content of the apps differ substantially, and consequently songs and Smoola are not shared between iOS and Android. Thank you for your understanding.3) For some devices where we know there are issues, we have restricted installs for now. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S II has audio bugs in the phone itself that make the Magic Piano experience... well, not so magical. However, Android hardware and software are constantly improving so if we are able to support some of these devices in the future we absolutely will!Recent changes:**Fixed crashes after songs in latest version-Earn dozens of FREE SONGS and SMOOLA by leveling up and unlocking Achievements!-Easier to select difficulty before playing a song.-Fixed a bug when sharing a performance to Facebook"
