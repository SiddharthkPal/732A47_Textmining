Connecting via WiFi is recommended where possible. Known Issues: - Some Samsung Galaxy S3 users may find that audio playback does not work for them for live or on-demand programmes.  This is due to a problem with a specific recent firmware version for this device. Devices purchased independently of your network operator should not be impacted.  A firmware fix has been deployed by Samsung but may take some time to be rolled out across all networks.  Podcast and video playback should not be affected.- This issue may also apply to other Samsung devices including some S2s- On demand/catchup programmes from local and regional stations are not yet available- Video clips are not currently available for Intel-based devices, such as the Motorola Razr-i, or Orange San DiegoRecent changes:Thanks for the feedback so far, we are taking the issues with some Samsung devices (in particular S3, S2 and Note running 4.1.2) very seriously, and we are working with Samsung and the mobile operators to rectify this firmware bug as soon as possible. This update provides increased reliability with audio stream playback, although it will not fix the above firmware issue we are seeing with some Samsung devices.'
