S'Are you avoiding buying on eBay because getting outbid too often? Make buying on eBay fun again!Snipe to win on eBay.Myibidder Bid Sniper for eBay allows you to snipe auctions on eBay by placing the last seconds bid to increase your chances to win the item.No need to watch for auctions anymore, just set a snipe and let the sniper do the job for you.Once the snipe is set, you don\'t need to keep the app running for the snipe to work.PRO Version adds the following:1. Groups support (set a snipe for multiple items and stop bidding until you win 1 or 2)2. "Current Bid" fieldPro version:https://market.android.com/details?id=com.myibidder.aclient1.proHere is a nice review by guys at Which App.tv:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCUjH1mBIZAStep by step instructions on how to add an item for sniping:http://www.myibidder.com/forums/viewtopic/3719/howto-how-to-add-a-snipe-to-android-app/========================================================For those who never used eBay sniper in the past:1. SNIPING DOES NOT GUARANTEE WINNING. YOU HAVE TO MEET EBAY\'S AND SELLER\'S REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO WIN.ALSO, YOUR SNIPE MUST BE READY (ADDED & ACTIVATED) AT LEAST 3 MINUTES IN ADVANCE.2. YOU CAN STOP SNIPING IF YOU HAVE AT LEAST 1-2 MINUTES TO GO BY SETTING "OFF" ON "Activate Snipe" AND SAVING YOUR CHANGES.3. IT\'S ALSO TECHNICALLY NOT POSSIBLE TO SHOW THE CURRENT BID IN REAL-TIME IN THE APP. IT\'S PARTIALLY AVAILABLE IN PRO VERSION. THE CURRENT PRICE DOES NOT AFFECT SNIPING ANYWAY.Questions? Want to get answers? Please feel free to ask:http://www.myibidder.com/forums/Android Market is not for questions or suggestions. We have no way to contact you back and answer you through feedbacks.========================================================CURRENT LIMITATIONS:a. No Groups management (Get the Pro version if you need Groups)b. Does not refresh information automatically so if you miss snipe status, you have to do "Refresh" from the My Main MenuIf you expect any of those features, please do not download the app and leave 1 star because you expect it to be there.Those features will be added in the future versions soon.========================================================The application uses Myibidder.com service (originally named Myibay.com) to place your snipes, so you can turn off or disconnect your phone after you scheduled your snipe.Currently, the service processes over 150,000 snipes weekly.Sniping is done using eBay US by default.The Myibidder.com service is completely free.The service is supported by donations of our users:http://www.myibidder.com/login/donateThis application is in Beta stage, it\'s a proof of concept and testing user interface design. However, it\'s capable of placing real snipes on real eBay listings.There are few bugs here and there, but it should not affect sniping.Make sure you have at least 3-4 minutes before auction ends when scheduling your snipe.Security tokens has very limited support. It\'s recommended not to use it when sniping. Please contact support for more details.By using Myibidder.com service you have to agree to the following terms:http://www.myibidder.com/login/termsThe comments on Android Market are NOT for bug reports and suggestions. If you want to suggest something or found a bug to be fixed, please use the following Myibidder.com official forums for bug reports and support:http://www.myibidder.com/forums/view/10/mobile-android-ios-app-support/It will not be fixed if you don\'t let us know on the forums.Permissions used:Internet connections: the app needs to be able to make connections in order to schedule snipes, retrieve your snipes information, etc.Read logs: the app reads its own logs and error messages in order to properly address each crash. It does NOT access your personal information.=========All 2 permissions are required for the app to run properly. Otherwise, the app won\'t work. The permissions will not be dropped.=========Recent changes:* Improved reliability of Database access* Work-around for another issue on Samsung phones* Fixed one weird crash on My Items screen (thanks Chris for reporting)'
