Kids get to practice making their very own letters, both upper and lower cases, by carefully tracing the letter on a railroad track with their choice of train car.3. Garages with Surprises. Children are now tested to see if they can find the right letter. They need to open the correct garage, as their engine drives inside and pulls out a cargo car with a surprise.4. Phonics Cargo Train.  This activity teaches children to identify correct letter sounds within the context of words. The child\xe2\x80\x99s task is to load the correct cargo boxes into the train.5.
