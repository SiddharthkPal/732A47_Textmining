Schulz.Charlie Brown and his creator are both the sons of barbers, but whereas Schulz\'s work is described as the "most shining example of the American success story", Charlie Brown is an example of "the great American un-success story" in that he fails in almost everything he does. Charlie Brown is a lovable loser, a child possessed of endless determination and hope, but who is ultimately dominated by his insecurities. Charlie has a "permanent case of bad luck," and is often taken advantage of by his peers. He and Lucy Van Pelt star in a running gag that recurs throughout the series: Lucy holds a football for Charlie Brown to kick, but pulls it away before he can kick it, causing Charlie Brown to fly into the air and fall on his back.He is thoughtful and intelligent, but Charlie Brown is constantly hindered by his own self-doubt, or by others tearing him down. He is a failure in many of his pursuits, such as baseball, and is often blamed for everything, even when it isn\'t his fault. However, he is relentlessly determined to win, and, while he often gets rejected, continues to bounce back optimistically.Schulz acknowledged that he created Charlie Brown as somewhat of a self-portrait, in that the character shares Schulz\'s self-doubt and insecurities. Despite popular belief, Charlie Brown is not bald. Though Charlie Brown is drawn with only a small curl of hair at the front of his head, and a little in the back, Charles M. Schulz has explained that he saw Charlie Brown as having hair that was light and cut short, so that it could not be seen very easily.Charlie Brown first appeared in 1947, three years before Peanuts started, in a comic strip by Charles M. Schulz called Li\'l Folks. He later appeared in the first Peanuts comic strip on October 2, 1950. He is one of the most well-known characters in Peanuts and is considered to be the main character in the strip.Charlie Brown stated in an early strip (November 3, 1950) that he was "only four years old", but he aged over the next two decades, being six years old as of November 17, 1957 and "eight-and-a-half years old" by July 11, 1979. Later references continue to peg Charlie Brown as being approximately eight years old. Another early strip, on October 30, 1950, has Patty and Shermy wishing Charlie Brown a happy birthday on that day, although they are not sure they have the date right.Charlie Brown is an avid kite-flyer, but his kites keep landing in a "Kite-Eating Tree" or suffering even worse fates. In one strip from 1958, he finally gets the kite to fly before it spontaneously combusts in the air.Every autumn Lucy van Pelt promises to hold a football for Charlie Brown to kick, and every year she pulls it away as he follows through, causing him to fly in the air and land painfully on his back. Charlie Brown was never shown as succeeding to kick the football in the comic strip. In a strip from 1979, in which Charlie Brown is in hospital, Lucy promises she will never pull the football away again. She does not pull the football away when Charlie Brown tries to kick it after he gets well, but he misses the football and kicks her hand. However, he kicks it in a 1981 TV special, It\'s Magic, Charlie Brown when he was invisible. In a strip from 1999, Lucy delegates the task of holding the ball to her brother Rerun van Pelt. Rerun does not reveal whether Charlie Brown kicks the ball or not.Recent changes:- Supports Android phones- Native support for Android Tablets (HD Images look great on there) - Optimized to save battery life- High resolution HD pictures- Portrait and Landscape Mode Support- Setting option to change between 30 seconds and 2 minutes pictures rotations- New (v1.0.7): Speed and bug fixes- New (v1.1.0): Faster and smoother scrolling- New (v1.1.01): 3 new championship pictures added- New (v1.1.02): Fix Boot up crash- New (v1.3.02): Added Android 4.1 Jellybean support'
