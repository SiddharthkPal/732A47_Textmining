Auto manage 3G/4G/WiFi connection in the background2. Show battery level and usage in the status bar3. Efficient & easy to useWhat customers are saying:\xe2\x9c\x94 I had another, "easier", battery saver installed on my new Neo V on Jan 18th. It consistently turned on background traffic and connection to mobile network costing me about 1MB/24h. 2x Battery saved my data package, not 1 Kb wasted! Needless to say battery performance improved by 30%-35%.Thank you! (Foivos L)\xe2\x9c\x94 My battery life on HTC sensation is around 3-4 days now compared to 24 hrs before All other apps like juicedefender, green power, etc which I tried before, suck big time. Thumbs up! (patrick)\xe2\x9c\x94 Simply awesome..battery last almost 20 hrs compared to only 8 hrs before on my sgs2. (dr_nurulsyakirin)\xe2\x9c\x94 This is great. I had juicedefender which worked well, but this makes it last literally like 3 hours longer. (Kelby)\xe2\x9c\x94 Great app. Keeps me from having to manually turn off mobile data to save battery life.
