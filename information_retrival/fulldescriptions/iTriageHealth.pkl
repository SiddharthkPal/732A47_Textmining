We used the app to check every possible symptom/cause and looked at related videos and photos. After seeing all this information she was satisfied that she was indeed fine and nothing was seriously wrong. ITriage saved the both of us a lot of anxiety, a possible hospital visit and provided peace of mind at the touch of a button and did it all for free. I certainly will recommend this very useful app to others.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dan, Pleasantville, NY * \xe2\x80\x9cMy son has had appendix area pain on and off for months and [iTriage] has helped me try to figure out what is wrong with him.
