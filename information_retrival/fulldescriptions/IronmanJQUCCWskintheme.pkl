You can try choosing your "weather provider" and "location" in UCCW\'s settings, that should fix it!HOW DO I EDIT HOTSPOTS AGAIN?To edit hotspot again, open the uccw app and in uccw\'s settings, select "lock widgets" to "OFF". Tap your widget and edit it as you please, then re-enable it when you\'re done. MY NOVA LAUNCHER DOES NOT HAVE "TABLET" OPTION IN SCROLL EFFECTThis is a optional option, in other words it is not necessary to have this option to make the theme work.Scroll effect is the effect that you get when scrolling the pages, basically you can just skip this step.I DON\'T HAVE THE "THREE DOT" BUTTONThe three dot button in the video tutorial is the same as pressing "menu" on your hardware button.I DO NOT HAVE QUICKPICQuickpic is just another gallery application which handles your images. It does not matter which gallery application you use when setting up your icon or wallpaper.I CANNOT FIND THE WALLPAPER AND ICONDownload the wallpapers and icons through the mirror 1 and 2 links above. Save the files to your picture folder in your sd-card/internal storage.CAN I USE LAUNCHERS OTHER THAN "NOVA"?Yes, you can use launchers like "ADW launcher" or "GO Launcher", as long as the launcher provides many customize-able features!I DON\'t HAVE THE "TABLET" OPTION IN NOVA SETTINGSThis option is optional, it\'s not necessary at all to complete the theme. This simply just a scrolling effect which - on again - is unnecessary. HOW DID YOU CHANGE THE SOFTWARE BUTTONS?You must be rooted to do so. If you\'re already rooted, e-mail me and I\'ll send you the software buttons. Even people who did not purchase this app can receive it free of charge.======================================Disclaimer: Original concept by the amazing team at Prologu (http://prologue.com/).This UCCW skin is NOT affiliated to the franchise "Iron Man" nor The Walt Disney Company.Recent changes:Version 1.0.7- Fixed "not showing in UCCW" issue.Version 1.0.1- Changed install locationVersion 1.0.0- Initial release'
