S'Bored while commuting? No time to read? Learn something while working out? Player FM helps you discover and play talk shows on hundreds of topics. Offline playback is supported too. Yes, it\'s a podcast app, but not the one your grandpa used! What sets the app apart from other podcasting applications is its emphasis on discovery- GigaOM(A)ttractive UI and some of the same features that any good podcast app should have. What this new app really brings to the table is the way it presents new content to podcast listeners.- Android CentralThis is a new app, the downloading model is optimised for simplicity. That means:* The app just downloads latest episodes, and that\'s it. You can\'t delete episodes manually, they\'re auto-deleted. To download older episodes, you can use the app\'s Export feature to save audio files to file system. A future version will let you download and play older episodes inside the app.* Episode downloading is ON by default, but only in Wifi mode. For 3G/4G downloading, go into settings and turn that on. We\'ve also made a critical fix to an issue that caused excessive downloading - more info at http://bit.ly/bandwidth-update.Features: \xe2\x80\xa2 Stream or sync...it\'s your choice. We make it convenient to stream from online sources just like an internet radio, but we also support syncing so you can play offline, anytime. Many sync options are supported (download limits, wifi-only, charging-only, more). \xe2\x80\xa2 Your subscriptions live in the cloud, so you can sync them across Android devices. You can always export them as OPML to switch to another app. And you can import OPML from other podcast apps too.\xe2\x80\xa2 Player FM is a web app too (http://player.fm). Our website lets you search, browse, play, and manage your subscriptions. Works on many desktop and mobile browsers.\xe2\x80\xa2 Browse 300+ topics. These aren\'t just catalogue items, they\'re live channels combining latest episodes from high-quality providers. Star your favorite topics to keep them in the quick-access menu. We have channels on comedy, latest news, current affairs, TV shows, and so on. In addition, there are many specialised professional and academic topics, e.g. programming, health and science, language learning.* Don\'t want to browse? Search is now in the app too, by popular demand.\xe2\x80\xa2 Get social. With a public profile, you\'ll be able to show friends what you\'re subscribed to. Don\'t worry - private profiles are possible too! Note that you can log in via traditional username/password as well as Google Plus login, and there\'s also a guest mode with no login required.\xe2\x80\xa2 View shownotes and descriptions on any episode or series and share with other apps. Supports Android Share feature to share episodes and series.\xe2\x80\xa2 For any topic, you can flip between a graphical view showing series thumbnails and a list view showing latest episodes.\xe2\x80\xa2 Browse full history for any series you\'re looking at; if it\'s in their RSS feed, you can load it and play it.\xe2\x80\xa2 Homescreen widget? Lockscreen widget? Notifications? Check, check, check. All interactive, allowing you to pause/play and skip to next track. When inside the app, you\'ll always be able to control playback from our "permaplayer", no matter what screen you\'re on.\xe2\x80\xa2 Star up to 50 topics and manage up to 20 subscriptions, always free.
