When the app requests root permission, your SuperUser application will give you a prompt so it is definitely safe. ***NOTE: Only Hong Kong database is available at the moment. Database for other countries will be available later.*** 2013/5/3: This application does not support new version of MIUI (Known on 3.4.26+), this is the problem of MIUI, there is nothing I can do ****** For most LG phones, only legacy muting is supported ****** 2012/5/2: For users with Android 4.0.3+, if blocking has no effect, make sure any automatic process killers have this program placed in whitelist or exception ***This application does not support MIUI ROM. On LG P970, only legacy mute function can be used.*** For those who don't read Changelog: If the problem crashes after upgrading from 2.x, either clear program data or uninstall and install the software again ***This program is a Call Filter application for use in Hong Kong only, due to its nature of using a Hong Kong call filter list.From v1.01, English interface is also available.See Chinese description or http://www.studiokuma.com/skcf/ for change log.Recent changes:Date of internal database is 2013/5/3- Added checking to prevent update failure when HKJunkCall adds record types* If database is older than the internal one, it will be updated automatically when a call is received or the application is run. Don't use any functions in the application until the process completes."
