The speech synthesis module also needs to be configured to generate United Kingdom English as the language selected.  If the SVOX library is not installed in your device, Google Play will automatically open the relevant page so it can be downloaded for free, as it is required in order for the app to run properly.   Note: Do not close the Python service that is enabled on the upper left-hand side as the app is opened, since this is required for its correct operation.Recent changes:You can now pause the voice generation at any time and use a zoom function on images.  We continue to work to improve the app and also get the full course with 45 steps ready soon.
