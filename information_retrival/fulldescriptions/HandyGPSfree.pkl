S'This app is a real navigation tool designed for outdoors sports like hiking, bushwalking, mountain biking, kayaking and trail riding. Its simple to use and works even in the remotest back country since it doesn\'t need network connectivity. It allows you to work in UTM or lat/lon coordinates so you can use it with your topographic maps. Waypoints and track logs recorded in the field can be be viewed later in Google Earth.Base features:* Shows your current location in easting/northing (UTM) or in lat/lon.* Shows your speed, direction of travel, and total distance travelled in either metric of imperial/US units.* Can store your current location as a waypoint, and can store your track as a "breadcrumb" trail to show where you\'ve been.* Waypoints and breadcrumb trails can be imported from and exported to Google Earth KML and GPX files.* Allows manual entry of waypoints in UTM or lat/lon coords.* Can guide you to a waypoint with the "Goto" screen using true or compass bearings.* Has a magnetic compass page.* Computes the local magnetic declination at startup using the IGRF-11 model, for use on the goto page.* Can display either a simple map of your current location and the stored waypoints, or a Google Map if a data connection is available.* Supports the world-wide WGS84 datum along with the Australian datums and map grids AGD66, AGD84, GDA94, AGD, GDA, AMG, and MGA. (You can also use WGS84 for NAD83 maps).* Shows satellite locations and signal strengths graphically.* Can display simple or MGRS grid refs.* Has online help pages.* Thoroughly tested by the developer on bushwalks.Extra features available only in the paid version:* A custom datum can be configured using ellipsoid and shift parameters.* An email containing a clickable link showing your location can be sent to a friend using gmail.* An elevation profile of your route can be shown.* Can average GPS locations over time to give a more accurate result.* Unlimited number of waypoints and breadcrumb trail points.NOTE: This free version is limited to storing only 3 waypoints, and 20 breadcrumb track points.
