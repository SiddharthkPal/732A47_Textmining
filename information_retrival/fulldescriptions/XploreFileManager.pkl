All these memory types are listed in main level, you don\'t need to search for their folders on the device.Access to FTP and FTPS (secure FTP) servers is supported.Multiple servers may be configured.

Files can be selected by clicking check box. It is also possible to select all files in a folder, or clear selection, by clicking parent folder\'s check box.Opening file may mean to use one of built-in viewer for most popular file types: images, audio, video and text.Or you may configure X-plore to use system application for opening files, in which case system-predefined application that can open particular file is launched.Archives (currently supported are Zip and Rar) are displayed as other folders. You may open them, see contents, and do standard operations that you\'d do on files - rename, delete, copy from/to, etc.Additional interaction is possible by button bar, which is between two panes, and is fully configurable.
