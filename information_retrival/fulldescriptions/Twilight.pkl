S'Are you having troubles to fall asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.The cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.In experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.The Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the blue spectrum on your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.Please read the basics on circadian rhythm and the role of melatonin:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatoninhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanopsinhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythmshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm_disorderExamples of related scientific research:        Amplitude Reduction and Phase Shifts of Melatonin, Cortisol and Other Circadian Rhythms after a Gradual Advance of Sleep and Light Exposure in Humans        Derk-Jan Dijk, Jeanne F.
