Installed on my Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch and not only works flawlessly, it does everything it said it would. I use Winamp and this app completely negates the need to "go pro". It also works for any other installed media player on my phone (MX, Pandora, etc). A "MUST HAVE" app for people who love to use their smart phone as their primary media playback device at home or on the go. This program ROCKS!!!"Asitha *****"Mega Bass\tOne of the greatest apps for Android\xe2\x84\xa2. Cool. A++++++. 10/10"Lee *****A must have app makes music near perfection !!Judd *****"Simply the best\tI\'ve tried every eq app available in the market and i\'d say this is the best. I\'m not even satisfied with all the players with built in 10 band eq. The only downside is after listening,with your music it\'ll automatically turn off. Other than that it\'s great!"Please feel free to send us your feedback.* Android is a trademark of Google Inc.Recent changes:Added option to remove all advertisements with GetJar gold.'
