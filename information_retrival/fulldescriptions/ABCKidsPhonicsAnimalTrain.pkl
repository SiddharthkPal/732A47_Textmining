If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait a minute, and come with me!!! But first let me tell you a story\xe2\x80\xa6. ****************************************** Once upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame\xe2\x80\x94all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island\xe2\x80\x99s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. The legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. All that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers\xe2\x80\x99 names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island\xe2\x80\x99s precious treasure! ****************************************** But, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! And now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting!
