S'Belly is a universal loyalty program that offers one-of-a-kind rewards at the businesses you love, replacing boring "Buy 10, Get 1 Free" punch cards with free stuff you actually want. Belly users check in at the in-store iPad, earning points which can later be redeemed for rewards that are unique to each individual business. With Belly, we offer one customer loyalty card to replace the rest. Link the mobile app to your physical BellyCard which can be picked up at any Belly Business. Use the app\'s "Nearby Places" feature to find locations to Belly when you\'re out and about on the town. Earn a free cup of coffee at the donut shop down the street. Name the Sandwich of the Month at your local deli. For the first time, you can have your cake and eat it too, or at least have the option of shoving it into your baker\'s face. Add the Belly widget to your Homescreen or your Lockscreen for instant access!
