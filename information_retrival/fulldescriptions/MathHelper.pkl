S'Universal application of higher mathematics, which helps you not only to solve the problem, but also to see and understand the process of solving it, step by step.MathHelper\xe2\x80\x99s marks of quality and excellence: \xe2\x80\x93 The application is included in the Intel \xc2\xae Learning Series Alliance software packs\xe2\x80\x93 It is rated above 4.7 on Google Play with many positive reviews.Here are just a few user reviews:> "Perfect companion for the challenges on the linear and probability theories!"> "Thanks to the authors, for a nominal fee I bought the app without thinking, it will probably cost more for the test for mathematics"> "Great app. I bought it and don\xe2\x80\x99t regret it. "This application is a universal assistant for those who deal with advanced mathematics. You can be a higher school student, a university student or even a graduate \xe2\x80\x93 If you need immediate mathematical assistance \xe2\x80\x93 MathHelper is always at hand!You can forget about all the heavy books and numerous tricks with the tips, which in most cases do not guarantee that you\xe2\x80\x99ll solve your maths problem.MathHelper enables you to not only to solve the problem, but also to understand the process of solving it, step by step. This convenient multifunctional calculator includes an extensive theoretical guide in several languages. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get an algebraic mini-laboratory that is stored conveniently and compactly on your Android!Now, you can not only quickly find the answer, but also handle similar problems in the future. Your classmates and teachers will be very surprised with the results of your work.MathHelper allows calculating propositions and solving problems in linear and vector algebra in six sections at the moment:1. Operations with matrices:* Transpose of a Matrix* Finding the determinant of a Matrix* Finding the inverse of a Matrix* Addition and subtraction of matrices* Matrix multiplication* Scalar multiplication of Matrices* Calculating the rank of a matrix2. Solving systems of linear equations:* The Gauss method* The Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s method* The Inverse Matrix method3. Vectors:* Finding the length (magnitude) of a vector* Checking if two vectors are collinear* Orthogonal vectors * Sum, difference, scalar product* Finding the cross product* Finding the angle between two vectors* Finding the cosine of the angle between two vectors* Finding the projection of a vector onto another* Coplanar vectors4. Figures:* Finding the area of a triangle* Show that four points lie on the same plane* Finding the volume of a tetrahedron (pyramid)* Finding the volume and height of the tetrahedron (pyramid)NEW! 5. Mathematical analysis - Derivatives:* Derivative of the function* Derivative of the function given parametrically* The derivative of the implicit function6. Probability theory:* Finding expectation sample* Finding the sampling variance* Finding the number of permutations of a set of n elements* Finding the number of placements and combinations (n, k)7. Number theory and sequence:* Prime factorization* Finding GCD and LCM* The least common multiple and greatest common divisor* Complex numbers: Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division* Raising a complex number to a power* The first terms of a progression (arithmetric and geometric)* Finding Fibonacci numbers* Solution of linear Diophantine equations* Finding the values of Euler\xe2\x80\x99s function* The factorial n!Learn math in a new way with MathHelper!Recent changes:...1.1.4: English localization issues fixed, Range of supported devices increased2.0.0 The number sequences and Probability Theory added, as well as German language support2.0.2 Small stability fixesFixed localization defects; small design updates; fixed possible defects in solving linear equations by Gauss method; increased stability2.0.6 Stability fixes2.1.0 New functionality was added - the derivatives. New localization - Italian. Fixed several bugs'
