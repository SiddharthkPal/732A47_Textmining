With Air Stream, we are trying to address this. AirStream allows you to access media over your wifi network using HTTP protocol. Air Stream searches for computers or smartphones connected to the same wifi network and identifies them. It then displays the list of devices available & you can browse to your favourite media content & even share media over wifi. It can also act your remote file browser.Air Stream primarily started as part of our Android-IPTV box project, where we needed a tool to stream / share media content from computers at home over wifi. This is something similar to DLNA or Share via HTTP - File Transfer, but being independent gives us much more control over defining streaming protocol and user experience. It is somewhat closer to Apple's AirPlay.Features:\xe2\x80\xa2 Stream Movies, Music and Photos from PC your Mobile Phones and Tablets\xe2\x80\xa2 Copy files from PC to your Mobile Phones and Tablets without the hassle of wires\xe2\x80\xa2 Automatically Identifies computers in your network - support for Windows, Mac & Linux\xe2\x80\xa2 Restrict access to files from your PC\xe2\x80\xa2 AirStream comes with file filters for Videos, Music and Photos to make it very easy to access your content\xe2\x80\xa2 Its fantastic file browser makes it very easy to browse huge data within few gestures of your finger tipsUsage: 1.
