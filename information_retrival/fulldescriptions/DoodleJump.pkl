S'One of the hottest mobile games of all time - now FREE and finally properly optimized for Android by the same team that created the original version! See for yourself why Touch Arcade called Doodle Jump \xe2\x80\x9cpossibly the best [mobile] game ever created\xe2\x80\x9d and Macworld called it \xe2\x80\x9ca perfect micro-game, insanely addictive, and deliciously replayable.\xe2\x80\x9d How high can you jump?Journey up a sheet of graph paper, perpetually jumping from one platform to the next, picking up jet packs, avoiding black holes, and blasting baddies with nose balls along the way. Laugh with delight as you blow past other players\' actual score markers scribbled in the margins. And be warned: this game is insanely addictive! Features:-\tMany fantastical worlds to play in - Space, Jungle, Soccer, Underwater, Snow, Halloween, Ice, Easter, and now NINJA!!-\tAwesome power-ups to pick-up (JET PACKs, PROPELLER HATS, ROCKETS, trampolines...)-\tTrippy obstacles to avoid (UFOs, black holes, and many, many monstrous monsters)-\tMad platforms to jump on (Broken, moving, disappearing, shifting, EXPLODING\xe2\x80\xa6)-\tGlobal leaderboards, fun achievements!

That will remove the ads. If you have already uninstalled/deleted the old paid Doodle Jump version, you can re-download it from "My Android Apps" -> "Other apps in my library" or by going directly to: http://bit.ly/oldpaid  * This will work for most devices, but unfortunately not the ones that the old paid version is not compatible with. We are trying to come up with a solution for those. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Recent changes:NINJA THEME is now FINALLY available for Android!!!  We are working on also bringing the ninja store to Android asap. This will let you get super-cool outfits and powerups!***** Thanks for playing Doodle Jump!!!Follow us on Twitter for updates on Doodle Jump: @DoodleJump ( http://twitter.com/doodlejump ) Become a Doodle Jump fan on facebook: http://facebook.com/DoodleJump'
