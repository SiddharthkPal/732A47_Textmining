S'The complete book, FREE-------------------------------William Walker Atkinson was an influential member of the New Thought movement. He was one of the first people to write about the Law of Attraction.Long before Rhonda Byrne discovered the secret that one\'s positive thoughts are powerful magnets that attract wealth, health, and happiness, Atkinson already knew it.In this New Thought classic, Atkinson looks at the law of attraction in the thought world. He points out the similarities between the law of gravitation and the mental law of attraction. He explains that thought vibrations are as real as those manifesting as light, heat, magnetism and electricity. The difference is in the vibratory rate which also explains the fact that thought vibrations cannot usually be perceived by our 5 senses.He argues that there are huge gaps in the spectrum of light and sound vibrations, wide enough to include other worlds. It is logical that these activities would be perceived by sense organs attuned to them. Increasingly sophisticated scientific instruments are able to register more and more of these hidden frequencies.There is constant interaction between negative and positive thought vibrations - it is the task of the individual to raise the keynote of their mind to a positive pitch by an act of will. Atkinson discusses the purpose of affirmations as twofold: firstly, to establish new mental attitudes, secondly to raise the mental keynote. He also mentions that there must be a balance between giving out expressions and taking in impressions in a receptive state.The many faculties of the mind are identified and discussed, and the author asserts that the current of will-power flows strongly along spiritual wires but the individual must train in order to optimally tap into this energy source. The "I" is the master of the mind and the "will" is the instrument of the "I." Affirmations for internalising this insight are provided here.Atkinson also shows how to overcome negative emotions like fear, worry, envy, anger and hate. He firmly believes in the operation of universal law in all circumstances and advises the reader to tune in to the harmony of the law. I found the chapters Asserting The Life Force and Training The Habit Mind particularly helpful and inspiring.Although this book was written years ago, the text still sounds fresh and contemporary. The explanations of mental laws and processes are clear and concise and the exercises are simple and effective.----------------------------------Looking for ebooks?
