They might be as powerful as a computer, but they don\'t really understand you. They might not get the difference between Madonna the singer and the holy Madonna when all you want is to listen to some music, and they might show you games instead of nearby restaurants when all you want is sushi. If smartphones were so smart, you wouldn\'t have to work so hard to find relevant content when you need it.With the Everything.me launcher, all you have to do is enter whatever\'s on your mind - one or two words will usually do - and it\'ll understand and get it for you. \xe2\x96\xba Every app you\'ll needThings are simpler with a Dynamic Phone launcher: from the get-go, it brings you every app you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever need, native or web. \xe2\x96\xba Launch in contextWith an ordinary, static smartphone, your work\'s never done. Even when your apps are lined up all nice and tidy you still have to search inside them for the stuff you want. A Dynamic Phone is smarter \xe2\x80\x93 so smart, in fact, that it asks other apps for the content you\'re looking for. For example, if you\'re shopping for a new digital camera, just enter the name of the camera and all the relevant shopping apps will appear. Click on any of the apps, and it will open directly into the content you wanted - reviews, price comparisons, you name it. \xe2\x96\xba Smart FoldersManaging and maintaining your apps is a technical and logistical challenge. You need to search, install, register, log in, provide location, update, forget\xe2\x80\xa6 Apps demand your attention, cognition, awareness, memory....A Dynamic Phone works for you, not vice versa. You have pre-loaded Smart folders full of apps you use all the time \xe2\x80\x93 news, social, music, games and more. Every folder is instantly ready-to-use and dynamically updated.Your stuff is still hereYou might be asking yourself: now that my phone is Dynamic, where\'s all my static stuff? Well it\'s still all here, accessible at the touch of a button.Recent changes:- Support for new devices, including Samsung Galaxy S4- Create and customize your Smart Folders, including background images- Improved results for "What\'s on your mind?" dynamic home screen- By popular demand: Add and remove home screens- Beta bug fixes and speed improvements'
