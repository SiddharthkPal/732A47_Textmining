S'This is not just another text reader and more than speed reader.The reader has several unique features: - in Reader mode flashes words or phrases one by one sequentially on the screen, with regulated speed. - in 3D Stereo mode you can read with 3D effect on any device, without glasses. - in overview mode you can scroll or flip pages in the same time. - support pinch, spread and rotate gestures to change text size or screen orientation any time you need.  These features allows to turn reading into a useful and fascinating process, and reduce eye strain.AutoReader allows to read much larger text, what\'s important not only for people with impaired vision.But also, for example, in transport, on the go, on the running machine, etc. when focusing on a small text tiring for the eyes or impossible.Moreover, 3D Stereo mode can even be beneficial for the eyes, if done right, the visual axisare parallel (as when looking at the horizon), which relaxes the external eye muscles, and the focus is on the stereo pair,that helps to synchronize the focus of both eyes, which is also useful, as it\'s often one eye focuses better than the other (we can be unaware of it, but simply feel tired).Learn how to view stereograms: http://www.wikihow.com/View-StereogramsRead for the benefit of your eyes!
