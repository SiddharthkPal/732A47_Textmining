S'When you take pictures for your love ones, do you want to be part of it? Dual Camera app will help you to do that. It will take picture using the back camera on your phone for your love ones first, then it will use the front camera on your phone to take a picture of you. In the option menu, you can select the front camera image size, auto or manual to take the front camera picture. The time delay is for the auto front camera picture taking. If you find the front camera picture is too dark in auto mode, try to select a large time delay.This app is tested on Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy Nexus, HTC One X, HTC EVO 4G.If the app forces quit itself, please try to lower the front camera image resolution. It is probably a out of memory issue.In the Android system, it is not allowed to open 2 cameras at the same time except for Samsung Galaxy S4 and LG Optimus G Pro which are not available yet as the hardware is not supported. The only solution is take photo for the front and back camera one by one.Recent changes:Version 1.0 - First releaseVersion 1.2 - Fix out of memory bug for Note 2.If the app forces quit itself, please try to lower the front camera image resolution. It is probably a out of memory issue.'
