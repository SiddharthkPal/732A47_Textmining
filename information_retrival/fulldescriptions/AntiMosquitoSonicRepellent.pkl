This is due to limitations in human hearing. Humans can not hear ultrasound (mosquito sound) because the eardrum does not vibrate fast enough, but some animals such as dogs, bats and rodents can hear well into the ultrasonic range. Some insects, such as grasshoppers and locusts can detect frequencies from 50,000 Hz to 100,000 Hz, and moths and lacewings can detect ultrasound as high as 240,000 Hz produced by insect-hunting bats.Insects detect sound by special hairs or sensilla located on the antennae (mosquitoes) or genitalia (cockroaches), or by more complicated tympanal organs (grasshoppers, locusts, moths and butterflies).Electronic pest (mosquito repellent) control is the name given to the use of any of the several types of electrically powered devices designed to repel or eliminate pests, usually rodents or insects.Numerous electronic pest control devices (mosquito repellant) are readily available throughout the world. Hardware stores and garden centers usually stock some sort of electronic device advertised to repel a variety of pests and one can also find them on the internet. Although these devices (mosquito ringtones) have been around for at least 20 years, they have only recently become popular and widely advertised, probably due to their environmentally friendly claims.There is a wide range of opinion about these devices. Some people claim that they work for them, while others claim they are not effective at all.There are basically two types of electronic pest control devices widely available, these are Ultrasonic mosquito repellent (mosquito netting) and Electromagnetic mosquito repellent.An insect repellent is a substance applied to skin, clothing, or other surfaces which discourages insects (and arthropods in general) from landing or climbing on that surface. There are also insect repellent products available based on sound production, particularly ultrasound (inaudibly high frequency sounds). These electronic devices have been shown to have no effect as a mosquito repellent by studies done by the EPA and many universities.Insect repellents help prevent and control the outbreak of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, Lyme disease, dengue fever, bubonic plague, and West Nile fever. Pest animals commonly serving as vectors for disease include the insects flea, fly, and mosquito; and the arachnid tick.Tags: mosquito hawk, mosquito eater, mosquito ringtone, mosquito magnet, mosquito bites, mosquito squad, mosquito fish, mosquito soundRecent changes:v. 1.0- timer- run in background- 6 anti mosquito sounds- moved to SDcard'
