S'Trouble sleeping? Device screen too bright even on the lowest brightness setting? Want to give your phone a warm look instead of that eye straining blue gaze you see at night? EasyEyez is the solution. Inspired by Flux for the PC, EasyEyez changes your device\'s color temperature to reduce eye strain when looking at your device at night. Looking at a lower and natural light source gives your body a chance to produce more melatonin, helping to provide you with better sleep. With EasyEyez, you can now look at your phone at any point during the night while keeping your eyes in an easy, restful state. Features:* Warm Filter - Set the filter level to be applied to the screen.* Brightness Filter - Set the brightness level to be applied to the screen.Paid App Features:* Complete Filter Level Control - Seekbar to set the warmness and brightness settings.* Automatic Scheduler - Set EasyEyez to turn on automatically night after night.* Sunrise and Sunset Time - Set the schedule based on the sunrise and sunset.* Timeout Length - Set the length of time to re-enable EasyEyez.* EasyEyez Widget - Quickly and easily turn on and off EasyEyez. * Lowest System Brightness - Set the system brightness to the lowest setting.* NEW - Tasker support integration (Action available in "Plugin" category)What makes EasyEyez different? EasyEyez works on all Android devices and does not require root access to function. It also does not interfere with Android\'s system brightness giving you more control of your device\'s brightness.Why upgrade to the full version of EasyEyez?With the full version, you will have complete control over the warmness and brightness filters instead of just the default values. Using the automatic scheduler, all you have to do is set the time once and let EasyEyez do the work night after night. It will even set the times based on the sunrise and sunset wherever you are in the world. With the timeout feature of the scheduler, EasyEyez will know when to turn itself back on even when you have disabled it. You also have the ability to enable and disable EasyEyez in one click using the EasyEyez widget. Still see a slight glow with EasyEyez on? You have the ability to set the system brightness to the lowest setting and when turning off EasyEyez, it will even default back to the system\'s automatic brightness setting. All of these features, ad-free, plus more on the way.Have an idea for a feature you would like to see in EasyEyez?
