In some devices, the GPS does not work properly and Strava will not record effectively. If your Strava recordings show poor location estimation behavior, please try to update the operating system to the most recent version. We recommend running Android version 2.3.3 or above. Furthermore, there are some devices which have consistently poor performance with no known remedies. On these devices we restrict installation of Strava, for example Nexus One and HTC Hero. See our support site for more information: http://support.strava.com/kb/alerts-and-known-issues/does-strava-2x-run-on-my-android-deviceRecent changes:version 3.3.3:\xe2\x80\xa2 Fixed issue where application hangs during startup or saving recorded rides.* Fixed recording issue for Galaxy S3 Mini."
