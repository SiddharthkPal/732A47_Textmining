Valid credentials are required to connect to a windows domain.ActiveDir connects to any Windows Server Active Directory via an LDAP connection.  No additional software is required; however Active Directory Services does require a basic certificate configuration to enable encryption (req\'d to set passwords).  This is typical started by adding the AD Certificate or Certificate Services role.*RDP and VNC functions are provided by Yongtao Wang\'s remote tools.  All 5 rdp/vnc tools are supported and auto-detected when present, selecting pro over lite/ad supported.  Passing the current credentials (effectively SSO) only functions on Pro and Enterprise versions. http://www.remotespark.com/android_solution.html (also available on Android Market)*TLS Unavailable Error most likely indicates the domain controller isn\'t capable of LDAP encryption.  A connection can usually be made by disabling TLS and SSL in the connection profile.  This will allow a non-encrypted connection with the drawback that AD LDAP will not perform password updates without encryption.To enable LDAP Encrpytion (TLS and SSL):*Active Directory Certificate Services should be added to one  domain controller to provide SSL/TLS security, which is needed to set passwords.  In many environments this requirement may already be in place, if not adding a private Enterprise-CA for your organization is a fairly simple process.  More information is availiable in our FAQ here:   http://www.activedir.mobi/?page_id=12*ActiveDir is bound by the Active Directory Security policies that regulate directory security, authentication and object visibility.  Valid credentials must be used to gain required access to the AD system, standard (non-admin) user accounts can be used, under normal security permissions standard accounts cannot alter data without being granted Administrator or Special access.(*)Active Directory and Windows Server are a trademark of Microsoft Corp.Recent changes:1.23:-Raw Attribute View and Advanced Mode-Set a Search Base to search through only a portion of the directory tree.-Fixes for abstract screen and theme incompatibilities.'
