Put your legs together. Place your hands on the ground, palms down, fingers pointed forward. Balance your weight on your palms and your toes. Your hands should be shoulder width apart. Keeping your body straight, lower your body by bending your elbows. Go down until your chest almost touches the ground. Return to starting position. Elevated Push Ups:Same as the standard pushup, except you place your feet on a chair or Swiss ball or elevated surface. This allows you to hit your upper pecs more.  Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale.  Wide Push Ups:Same as the standard pushups, except hands are placed wider than shoulder width. This helps bring out your outer pectorals.\t Diamond Push Ups:Same as the standard pushups, except hands are positioned under the middle of your chest. Put your hands together so there looks like there is a diamond in between them (Index fingers touch each other and thumbs touch each other). This helps develop your inner pecs and your triceps.\t Basketball Push Ups:Same as the standard pushups, except you balance one hand on a basketball, medicine ball, or Swiss ball. This works stabilizer muscles. Three-Point Push Up:Same as the standard pushups, except you put one foot on top of the other.  So your points of contact are: 1.) left hand, 2.) right hand, and 3.) one foot while the other foot rests on its heel.  keywords: fitness trainer, body builder, gym, fitness pal, health, fit, pushups, push-ups workout, exercise, training, body.Recent changes:- New Forum section to talk about progress, exercise and techniques!- UI improvements'
