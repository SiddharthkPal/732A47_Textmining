Pivot Points are trend-predicting indicators (leading indicators) that are based on the average of the previous day\'s High (H), Low (L) and Close (C) prices. Here, "S" represents the support levels, "R" the resistance levels and "P" the pivot point. High, low and close are represented by the "H", "L" and "C\xe2\x80\x9d Pivot points can be used in two ways. The first way is for determining overall market trend: if the pivot point price is broken in an upward movement, then the market is\xc2\xa0bullish, and vice versa. Keep in mind, however, that pivot points are short-term trend indicators, useful for only one day until they need to be recalculated. The second method is to use pivot point price levels to enter and exit the markets. For example, a trader might put in a\xc2\xa0limit order\xc2\xa0to buy 100 shares if the price breaks a resistance level. Alternatively, a trader might set a\xc2\xa0stop-loss\xc2\xa0for his active trade if a support level is broken.A few tips :Price is bullish when trading above the pivot point.Price is bearish when trading below the pivot point.S1, S2 and S3 are important levels of support.R1, R2 and R3 are important levels of resistance.Trading Range S1-PP-R1 : Normal PositionTrading Range S2- PP - R2 : Oversold / Overbought PositionTrading Range S3- PP - R3 : Extremely oversold / Extremely overbought Position.Disclaimer :Invest at your own risk.
