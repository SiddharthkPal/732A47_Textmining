Add as many as you want to your master list, which appears on the app's home screen each time the program opens. This list may be viewed in traditional ascending order, in a grid format, or by the color of the note.- Taking a Note -Serving as a simple word processing program, the text option allows for as many characters as you're willing to type with your device's virtual or physical keyboard. Once saved, you can edit, share, set a reminder, check off or delete the note through your device's menu button. When checking off a text note, the app places a slash through the list's title, a mark that shows on the main menu.- Making To do List or Shopping List -In the checklist mode, you can add as many items as you'd like and move their order around with the up and down buttons activated in the edit mode. After the list is finished and saved, you may check, and uncheck, each line on your list with a quick tap that generates a line slash. If all items have been checked, the list's title is slashed as well.When you're finished using the notepad, an automatic save command preserves your individual note.Keywords : Notebook, NotePad, Notes, Shopping List, Todo list, Todo, To do List, To do, 2do, To-do, Shopping, list maker, Calendar, Task, Memo, text editor, Sticky Note,  Post It, notes, notepad, memo pad, memo widget, sticky, editor, getting things done, GTD, supports colordictRecent changes:** If you cannot find widgets, you have to move the app back to device in application settings and reboot your phone!** The best way to report bugs of the update is to send an email.3.9.17- Google Sign In error fixed- Email attachment view error fixed3.9.13- Supports auto link in checklist- Auto link setting changed : Settings -> Auto Link -> Auto link phone number- Supports Web Search (long press list item)3.9.8- Long tap checklist item to copy text"
