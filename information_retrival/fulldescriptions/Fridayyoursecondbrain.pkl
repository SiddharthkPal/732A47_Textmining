S"Friday is just like your brain. It captures events happening around you. The people you talk to, the places you visit, the images you capture, and the songs you listen to, etc. And like your brain, it initiates thoughts and ideas for you, it helps you remember information, it tries to anticipate actions.Friday is not just a backup service, on the contrary, it collates all the information including your location, people / contacts, moments, music, pictures, facebook, twitter and foursquare (social) feeds, apart from your calls, texts and mails to present you with a digitized form of memory which is searchable. In essence, friday becomes your best friend or an alter-ego with full access to your memory and important events.
