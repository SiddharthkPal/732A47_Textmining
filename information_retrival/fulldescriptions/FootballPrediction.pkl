S'Soccer Predictions and Soccer Results for every Punter in one App!The app can predict the outcome of most football games in the world in 3 possible ways: Double chance (lay home or lay guest), home win (back home) or away win (back guest). You are getting a free tipster service with this app for 85 leagues (more leagues be under way). It\'s your choice how to show the predictions, you can choose between asian handicaps, back/lay, write out text (home win, guest win, and so on) or numbers (1X2). For each prediction, an occurrence probability is stated. If the home win is predicted, the probability of a double chance (home win and draw) will also be indicated. Should an away win be predicted, the app will also show the probability for the double chance (guest win and draw).You can limit your football predictions for the next 24 hours only for better overview. Accordingly, the results can be shown exclusively for the last 24 hours as well or up to the last 10 days. The betting prediction for the football matches are based on a uniquely developed mathematical formula. The software is restricted on predictions for 1X2 bets (back bets) and double chance bets (lay bets), since it is nearly impossible to forecast the results precisely. So it\'s impossible to make a perfect result prediction the app shows the 3way and double bet chances for a game. By using the betting exchange "Betfair\xe2\x80\x99s" own app, the mobile website of "WilliamHill" or other bookmakers mobile optimized websites, you can check your own tips with this tool whilst on the road.
