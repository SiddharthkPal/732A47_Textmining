Your kind support is highly appreciated.A note for advanced usersSuperBeam creates an access point using Android\'s WiFi direct API\'s. This essentially works like hotspot mode in old devices, but it is guaranteed to work on newer devices like Nexus 7. Moreover, this mode allows older devices to connect and receive files without having to support WiFi direct\'s peer-to-peer connections.Also, please note that this mode is currently supported by Android versions 4.1 and greater. On older versions, SuperBeam will fallback to the older hotspot mode.Follow @SuperBeamApp on twitter (https://twitter.com/SuperBeamApp) for support and announcements.This app uses zxing library for QR code scanning and generation (https://code.google.com/p/zxing/)Recent changes:Version 2.1.1- Stop asking to enable NFC every time.- Fixed crashing on some handsets and custom ROMs.- Fixed QR code scanner for Xperia P and U.- Hide QR scanner hint overlay for good (please tap on it once).- Revert WiFi state on receiver after completion.- More light-weight QR codes.- Restore hotspot settings on sender after completion.- Some minor bugs and translation fixes.'
