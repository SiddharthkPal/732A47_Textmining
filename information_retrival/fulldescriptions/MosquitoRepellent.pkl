In order to to do this, she can recognise the sound of the vibrations from the wing beat of the male which it is claimed is sufficiently different from a females to enable this to happen \xe2\x80\x93 thus, upon recognising such wingbeats the female is \xe2\x80\x98repelled\xe2\x80\x99 away so as to avoid any further and now unwanted attentions of the male.Q.: Why i\'m hearing an hiss? / Why I don\'t hear nothing?A.: The app plays an high frequency sound. Some people under 30 years old can hear the sound, while over a certain age (variable from person to person) the ear lose the ability to hear high frequency sounds.Q.: Mosquitoes don\'t have ears, how do they hear sounds??A.: Insects don\'t have ears, but on feelers, that are the mosquitoes aural organs, there are about 15.000 sensorial receptors, structured so to create an "active ear" in which natural vibrations are generated so to amplify the incoming sounds. [Source: Le Scienze on-line]Q.: Are you telling me that the phone loudspeaker can play ultrasounds?A.: Actually the frequency used in Anti Mosquito is slightly under the ultrasounds threshold frequency. But it\'s very close to the limit that can be heard by the human ear (20 kHz), so for the sake of simplicity we called it "ultrasound", because a lot of people can\'t hear it.Q:why this app need 3 permissions ?A: 1.permissions "WAKE_LOCK" :WAKE LOCK permission needed to prevent screen from locking and it will not allow screen to sleep, If screen locked , application will stop.2.permissions  "WRITE_SETTINGS" :WRITE SETTINGS permission is needed to adjust the brightness of the screen inorder to SAVE BATTERY of device.3.permissions INTERNET & ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE :To display AdMob ads this permissions are needed.Recent changes:1.4 Updated1.3 Cosmetic changes1.2 Bug fixes1.1 Bug fixes1.0 First version'
