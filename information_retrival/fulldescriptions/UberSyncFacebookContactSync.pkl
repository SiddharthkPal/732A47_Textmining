S'Synchronize your Facebook contacts on Android. To configure, add the account or check status, go to "Settings => Accounts".Depending on how many friends you have, the first import might take a while, so be patient. IMPORTANT:* Facebook does not allow to export phone numbers.* Facebook users have the option to block one or all apps. If they opt for that, they will be EXCLUDED from your friends list. Please send bug reports or any kind of feedback.Consider submitting bugs directly on GitHub.
