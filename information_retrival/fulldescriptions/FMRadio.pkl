Other brands are in beta.Only works for motorola since motorola puts fm hardware in some of their products.  Other manufacturers do not include such hardware for saving money.On some devices, it can take up to 30 seconds  because the hardware and chipsets have to be rerouted. Once the application is closed, the chipsets and hardware will return to their previous settings.   No permanent changes will occur.'
