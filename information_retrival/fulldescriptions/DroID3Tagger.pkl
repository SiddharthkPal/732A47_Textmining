S"Have a bunch of mp3s on your phone... without tag, wrong tag info, random filename...???Your music organizing worries have come to an end... look no further. DroID3Tagger(droid3tagger) is here to do all the dirty work for you, so that you can sit back and relax to your favorite tracks without having to spend minutes searching for them on your phone.The DroID3Tagger uses the same technique used by products like Shazam and Soundhound to recognize your music... Acoustic Fingerprinting. So the apps needs no prior info about the song to help identify it.This version of the app identifies (AutoTag) the song, artist, album, albumart etc. and saves this info in the ID3 tags and also renames the mp3 to a more standard filename based on the info received from the server. The app uses the exhaustive database offered by the Last.fm's API so you can be rest assured that the app will find a match for the song.Loads of features are in store for the coming versions (you can only imagine).Any comments and suggestions are welcome.
