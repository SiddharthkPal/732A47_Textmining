S"*About our application's requested permissions*Version 2.5 of Go Daddy Mobile requests the following non-standard permissions:'Your personal information' This permission is required in order to auto-complete contacts in our new email client (your contact's email addresses will appear as you are typing).  Based on the way Android defines permission requests, we must ask for this access from all customers, even if you do not make use of our email client.  Your contact data is not collected or stored by us, is not transmitted to any third-party, and will not be used in any other way.  'Phone calls'This is an implied permission that Go Daddy does not use, but is present in our application because of the way that Google requests permissions for older versions of Android.  In our next app release we will remove support for the legacy menu button, which will erase this requested permission.  For those of you who want to confirm our usage, we invite you to look at our app manifest.  You will note we do not add the READ_CALL_LOGS permission.'System tools'This permission is utilized exclusively by a third-party crash reporting software that Go Daddy employs to more quickly identify app issues.   Go Daddy respects your privacy.  For more information about our privacy practices, please review our Privacy Policy, available within the application or on GoDaddy.com.
