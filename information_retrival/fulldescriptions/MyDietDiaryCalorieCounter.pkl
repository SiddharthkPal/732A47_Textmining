I lost over 10 pounds and found it better than Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Atkins, GI, or all those various personal diets out there. I tracked my weight-loss over time with the weight graph chart, tracked my calories, tracked my cholesterol intake, and more. Highly recommend!\xe2\x80\x9d - Sigor\xe2\x80\x9cProbably the best weight-loss app and calorie tracker out there.  I tried the scarsdale diet, HCG diet, south beach diet, medifast, mediterranean, and more but I gained weight again after I was done dieting. My Diet Diary, on the other hand, motivates you to just eat better. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple. Eating better meals is key to weight loss. It tracks your daily exercise and fitness too!\xe2\x80\x9d - Isaac\xe2\x80\x9cThe food and recipe database in My Diet Diary is amazing. I could search on several different foods and recipe search, and it would automatically display all the nutrition info. My husband is a vegetarian, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a vegan so it is important for us to track our protein intake. With Diet Diary, we can do that!\xe2\x80\x9d - Liz \xe2\x80\x9cEasy to use nutrition tracker! It feels like my personal dietitian, planner, and trainer. I was on the HCG diet before, Jenny Craig diet, low carb diet, weight watcher diet, and tried the juice detox. They all were not enjoyable, especially the juice diet! But the app I feel is helping me.\xe2\x80\x9d -- GwenRecent changes:* Daily reminders (in Settings)'
