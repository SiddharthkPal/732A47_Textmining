S'Are you missing the key layout you\'re used to from your computer? This keyboard has separate number keys, punctuation in the usual places, and arrow keys. It is based on the AOSP Gingerbread soft keyboard, so it supports multitouch for the modifier keys.This keyboard is especially useful if you use ConnectBot for SSH access. It provides working Tab/Ctrl/Esc keys, and the arrow keys are essential for devices such as the Xoom tablet or Nexus S that don\'t have a trackball or D-Pad.HAVE FEEDBACK, QUESTIONS, OR BUG REPORTS? Please send email to pocketworkstation@gmail.com or check https://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions. I can\'t help you if you leave questions or comments in a Play Store review, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any way to contact review authors.The permissions requested by the application are those needed by the underlying Gingerbread keyboard. It uses the contacts information for completion of names and email addresses, and audio recording for the voice input feature. On Android 4.1, you may see a spurious request for "call log" permission, this is a side effect of an OS change that will be fixed in the next update.The supported keyboard layouts include:- Armenian (\xd5\x80\xd5\xa1\xd5\xb5\xd5\xa5\xd6\x80\xd5\xa5\xd5\xb6)- Arabic (\xd8\xa7\xd9\x84\xd8\xb9\xd8\xb1\xd8\xa8\xd9\x8a\xd8\xa9)- Bulgarian (\xd0\xb1\xd1\x8a\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb3\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8 \xd0\xb5\xd0\xb7\xd0\xb8\xd0\xba)- Czech (\xc4\x8ce\xc5\xa1tina)- Danish (dansk)- English Dvorak (language "en_DV")- English (QWERTY)- English/British (en_GB)- Finnish (Suomi)- French (Fran\xc3\xa7ais, AZERTY)- German (Deutsch, QWERTZ)- Greek (\xce\xb5\xce\xbb\xce\xbb\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xce\xac)- Hebrew (\xd7\xa2\xd7\x91\xd7\xa8\xd7\x99\xd7\xaa)- Italian (Italiano)- Lao (\xe0\xba\x9e\xe0\xba\xb2\xe0\xba\xaa\xe0\xba\xb2\xe0\xba\xa5\xe0\xba\xb2\xe0\xba\xa7)- Norwegian (Norsk bokm\xc3\xa5l)- Persian (\xd9\x81\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xb3\xdb\x8c)- Portugese (Portugu\xc3\xaas)- Romanian (Rom\xc3\xa2n\xc4\x83)- Russian (\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9)- Russian phonetic (\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9, ru-rPH)- Serbian (\xd0\xa1\xd1\x80\xd0\xbf\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8)- Slovak (Sloven\xc4\x8dina)- Slovenian (Sloven\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dina)/Bosnian/Croatian/Latin Serbian- Spanish (Espa\xc3\xb1ol)- Swedish (Svenska)- Thai (\xe0\xb9\x84\xe0\xb8\x97\xe0\xb8\xa2)- Turkish (T\xc3\xbcrk\xc3\xa7e)- Ukrainian (\xd1\x83\xd0\xba\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x97\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd1\x8c\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0 \xd0\xbc\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb0)Completion dictionaries are provided by plug-in packages, see the "other applications by this developer" section for the currently available list.
