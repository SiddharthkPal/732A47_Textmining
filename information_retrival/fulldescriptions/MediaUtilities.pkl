Media Utilities is designed to give you unified tools for all of your media applications.  Do you like Pandora or Spotify, but wish each had notification controls? Media Utilities provides unified notification controls that let you control the most recently started media application as well as easily jump to it.Hate having to search for your media application just because you paused it? All of the controls keep track of the last running media application to let you easily resume or launch it.There are several widgets available on the Play store that let you play/pause any media application. But few  show you all of the meta data. Media Utilities gets all the meta data including cover art from your favorite media application (Pandora, Spotify, Songza, etc.) and displays it in a clean, unified widget.Media Utilities provides several different widgets to satisfy your particular needs, from a classic, single row design to a larger widget that displays cover art with hidden controls for the ultimate in clean design.Media Utilities is now in open beta. Feature requests and feedback are encouraged and would be greatly appreciated.Recent changes:>>> Latest Changes - Added direct mode - Added secondary metadata lookup - minor performance fixes - minor bug fixes>>>  Recent Changes Version 35 - Back added to everything (optional) - More widget Config - More WidgetsVersion 35 - Fixed rendering issue for 4x4 widgetsVersion 33 - Widget configurationVersion 32 - Added a 4x2 widget - Updated 4x4 widgets to include link to link to main activity.
