Turn off mobile data. Upload and sync files through WiFi. Kill apps or uninstall apps that are unnecessary. Use push notifications. Monitor battery life. Adjust screen brightness. Get rid of unused widgets. Deactivate GPS.ANDROID TASK KILLER & SPEED BOOSTERA task killer (also known as "app killer") can improve your Android\xe2\x80\x99s performance by forcing other apps to quit.
