Sound skipping during playbackA. Please increase the 'Audio Buffer Size' in the settings.* General note about choosing the best audio buffer sizeThe bigger the audio buffer size, the lower the chance you will hear unexpected clicks in the audio when using a lot of processing power. But at the same a bigger audio buffer size also causes a higher latency.Using a smaller audio buffer size gives you a lower latency, but then make sure your CPU can handle it, otherwise clicks may appear in your audio because the CPU can't process it all quick enough.Recent changes:1.8.8 (May 1, 2013) * added 'All Songs' option in the library submenu * bug fixes1.8.7 (April 24, 2013) * added new widgets   (1x1 folders and 1x1 playlists) * some other improvements and fixes1.8.6 (April 14, 2013) * critical bug fix   (thread blocking issue when initializing the ad system)"
