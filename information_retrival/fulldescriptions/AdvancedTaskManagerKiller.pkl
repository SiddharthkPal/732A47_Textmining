Apps cannot be prevented from restarting because of system limitation. We suggest you to enable auto kill in settings, and it will kill tasks on every screen off. It will help to save battery life and release memory for the phone.Q: How can I add apps to the ignore list?A: You can long press the task that you want to ignore, and then you will get a poped up context menu, click "Ignore". The ignored apps will not be shown in the task list, and will never be killed. You can manage the ignored apps in settings.Q: How can I manage startup apps?There is "Startup Kill" in settings. It can help you to kill tasks when system starts up.#Feedback------------------by Matt Meltzer--I honestly wish everyone who supports and uses ATK, would give your\'s a try.They\'d never go back to ATK!!!!ATM does SO much more than ATK!!!!A TON more features!!!!------------------------------------#TrademarkThe Android robot is modified from work created and shared by Google and used according to terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License.#KWapp killer, app manager, android boosterRecent changes:-v3.0.8#Fix a Force Close bug-v3.0.5#Fix a FC bug-v3.0.4#Game Booster Addon'
