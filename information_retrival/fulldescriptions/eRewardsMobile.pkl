S'e-Rewards Mobile+ is now available for Android - now you can answer surveys and earn Rewards on the go!e-Rewards Mobile+ uses special functionality for understanding how people use their mobile device.  e-Rewards Mobile+ captures user information about the device, location information, device usage, phone, SMS / text usage, app usage, Web usage, music and camera usage and uses this information to find targeted surveys, based upon how users are engaging with their mobile devices.Upon first time use, the app will ask your permission for collecting user information and location capture in the background.  Upon your acceptance, you will be able to use the app. Please note: If you currently use the iPinion app, you will not be able to log into e-Rewards Mobile+ (and vice versa).
