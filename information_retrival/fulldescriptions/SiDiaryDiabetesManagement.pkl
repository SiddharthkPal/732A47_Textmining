You can track all relevant data for your therapy like blood glucose, carbohydrates, medication like insulin and so on quick in a simple data mask to make it visible on your Android device. You can analyze it with the statistic function or with our trend analysis.If you already use the PC version of SiDiary to read out your meters, insulin pump, etc. - you can add this data also to your Android device by simply synchronizing it with SiDiary Online.The features of this app so far:\xe2\x80\xa2\teasiest entry of all data with the numeric keypad\xe2\x80\xa2\tall data can be tracked with a scrollable input mask\xe2\x80\xa2\tclearly arranged display of your daily data in SiDiary's typical style\xe2\x80\xa2\tlots of statistic-graphics (pie chart, line graph, modal day and detailed statistic)\xe2\x80\xa2\ttrend analysis (how was the progress of your therapy in the last days/weeks/months?)\xe2\x80\xa2\tfast synchronization of your data with 'SDiary Online', from where you are able to print your data stand-alone from your operating system or synchronize the data with your desktop computer version of SiDiary\xe2\x80\xa2\toption for automatically synchronization (after shut down the app and/or at midnight)\xe2\x80\xa2\tuser defined data types, which you have defined in your pc-version can also be used on the Android after a synchronization with 'SiDiary Online'\xe2\x80\xa2\tblood glucose values can be entered in mg/dl or mmol/l\xe2\x80\xa2\tbody weight can be entered in kg or lbs\xe2\x80\xa2\tcarbohydrates can be entered in gram or any other exchange unit (such as BE/KE, etc.)\xe2\x80\xa2\tdate format dd.mm or mm-dd\xe2\x80\xa2\ttime format 24h or 12h am/pm\xe2\x80\xa2\tdata rows that you don't want to use can be hiddenYou can use 'SiDiary Android' stand-alone, but this version can also enhance the pc-version - e.g. you can download readings from your blood glucose meter, insulin pump, blood pressure meter or pedometer with your pc-version and enter additional data on the way in your Android version.
