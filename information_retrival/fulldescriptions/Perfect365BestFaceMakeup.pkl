How do I move them?A: We recommend using the pinch gesture to zoom in to the desired key point to make it very clear exactly which point you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to move. When the whole image fits in the screen, the key points can be very close together and difficult to individually select.  Second, you need to tap and hold the key point for a couple seconds until the magnifier appears just above your finger. The appearance of the magnifier means you have the key point properly selected. If you tap too quickly and pull your finger away from the screen, the key point will not be selected. Also, if you tap and hold, but don\xe2\x80\x99t see the magnifier appear, you may find that you have the image selected and it will scroll the image if you move your finger. You \xe2\x80\x9cmissed\xe2\x80\x9d selecting the key point\xe2\x80\x94try tapping on it again.Q: I have a picture with a face in it that says no face was detected. What happened?A: Generally, the problem is with the source image. These are the most common reasons:     1. Subject should face directly at camera.     2. Use a high resolution photo.     3. Ensure the face is the primary region of focus.     4. Make sure to have sufficient lighting.     5. Make sure the face is large enough. If it\xe2\x80\x99s too small, there\xe2\x80\x99s may not be enough detail to work with.If you think that none of these apply to your picture, we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take a look at it and see if our face detection algorithms can be improved to support it.
