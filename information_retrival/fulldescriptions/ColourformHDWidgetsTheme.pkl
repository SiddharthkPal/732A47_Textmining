HD Widgets will look for it automatically.How do I use it?Colourform widgets will be in the top menu.What sizes are available?(2)  1x1(5)  2x1(36) 4x1(12) 4x2(36) 5x1(12) 5x2(1)  6x1(2)  6x2 (tablets)Recent changes:1.1- 30+ 5x sized widgets- fix for 2.3.x devices1.0.4- another fix for clocks*- removed permissions 1.0.1 - 1.0.3- reduced apk size- added permissions- min sdk 91.0- Brand New!* Sorry for the hassle. We tracked it down to a class that works fine in development and in the free test, but dies in the paid version. Same code, only difference was "paid" (except permissions, but that didn\'t work either). Such weird bugs...'
