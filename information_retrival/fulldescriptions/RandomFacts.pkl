There are silly facts, animal facts, science facts, completely random out of the blue facts, and much more.Random Facts  is simple to use.  Just click back, next to navigate through the constantly growing database of facts, or roll the dice for a random fact!If there's a certain fact you want to see, click on the fact counter and enter a number to go to that fact. Play around with random numbers to see which facts you'll get.If you find a fact you think is funny, outrageous, interesting, or completely ridiculous; Share it with your friends or press the star to add it to your favorites list!We're always reviewing the database and adding new facts based on your input!
