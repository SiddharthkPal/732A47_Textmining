At present, donate and free versions of the app are identical. In future we intend to supplement the donate (Pro) version with some benefit features, which would be unavailable in free edition.This application does not host any files, it merely is a search engine and the developer is not liable in case of misuse. All files are available in the public domain. Search results are drawn from third-party sites across the web and developer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t endorse the companies or contents of any of such sites. We are not responsible for downloads from file hosting sites, because there are a lot of them and each needs its own approach. We are not responsible for registration on fileshare.We highly appreciate your kindness and support in helping us to spread and improve General Downloader (General Files Search).
