Location data is not currently used in any other capacity.* Network Communication - Ibotta must use your network in order to communicate with our servers. This is how we deliver offers, record your engagement responses, receive your receipts, etc. We also request permission to read the state of the network to detect when internet is unavailable.* Read Your Contacts - In order to present a list of people that you may want to invite to use Ibotta, we must have permission to read your contacts. We do not use your contacts for any other purpose than this.* Storage - When you take a picture of your receipts, we need to store the image on disk temporarily until the receipts are completely uploaded, or you cancel out of the camera. We also request permission to check whether disk storage is accessible.* System Tools - In order to allow you to watch a video to completion without the phone going to sleep we must have this permission. It simply allows us to keep the screen on during video playback.* Your Accounts - We deliver system notifications to your device when we want to communicate newsworthy events, such as the status of one of your receipts or new offers. You have control over which notifications you want to receive in the Settings section of the app. Notifications are delivered through Google's Cloud Messaging (GCM) framework. In order to target your device for a notification, GCM, and therefore Ibotta, must know the account you are currently using.Recent changes:1.4.2\xe2\x80\xa2 Bug fixes. \xe2\x80\xa2 Fix for LG Lucid blurry images.\xe2\x80\xa2 Fix for bonus details on large screens."
