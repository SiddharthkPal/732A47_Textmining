S'Graphing calculator with algebra. Essential tool for school and college. Replaces bulky and expensive handheld graphing calculators.Multiple functions on a graph, polar graphs, graphing of implicit functions, values and slopes, roots, extremes, intersections. Algebra: polynomials, polynomial equation solving, matrices, fractions, derivatives, complex numbers and more. Shows results as you type. Use menu to switch between modes.Free version requires internet connection and contains ads! $5 in-app upgrade to PRO. Contact us if you need multiple licenses for a school or organization.Help site with instructions and examples: http://help.mathlab.usIf you have a question, send email to calc@mathlab.usSCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR* arithmetic expressions +,-,*,/,\xc3\xb7* square root, cube and higher roots (hold root key)* exponent, logarithms (ln, log)* trigonometric functions sin \xcf\x80/2, cos 30\xc2\xb0, ...* hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, tanh, ...
