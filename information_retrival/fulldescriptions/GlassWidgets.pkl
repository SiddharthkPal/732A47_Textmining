FAQ:1) I can't find the widgetsThe widgets don't show up in the App-drawer. Instead, they can be found in the widget list. The widget list is opened by tapping and holding on an empty space on the home screen. 2) I still can't find the widgets The most common cause of this problem is that the widgets are installed on the SD-card. Android doesn't like widgets on the SD-card. Please try to move them back to the main memory of the phone/tablet.3) How do I change the settings for a widget?If you tab the upper left corner of the widget, the setting screen for that widget will open. If you tab the lower left corner, the widget will refresh itself.Enjoy!Recent changes:I removed the 'OK' button in the preferences. Now you wont lose all you changes if you press 'back' one time too many by mistake. Instead, any changes made to the preferences automatically take effect when you leave the preference screen.Also, I made some further tinkering with the weather provider. I never had this much problems with the old Google weather service."
