S'"A new era of file sharing" - appszoom.com"The beauty of this utility is its simplicity" - redmondpie.comFinally even older devices can send files at speeds like Wi-Fi Direct!Fast File Transfer is an alternative for Bluetooth file sending.The app uses Wi-Fi Tethering for establishing a connection between the devices but does not need the Internet.Due to its high speed, this technology is especially recommended for sending big files.Features:\xe2\x80\xa2 Up to 20x speed of bluetooth\xe2\x80\xa2 Easy to setup\xe2\x80\xa2 The receiver is device-independent\xe2\x80\xa2 No need for a common Wi-Fi connection\xe2\x80\xa2 No data usage for file transfer (Just for advertisements)\xe2\x80\xa2 The receiver does not have to have the app installed\xe2\x80\xa2 Send single or multiple files\xe2\x80\xa2 Displays QR codes for faster receiving  Just tap the instruction image\xe2\x80\xa2 Use NFC for pairing (in beta stage)Using this app, you can easily send a file to an iPhone or any other phone that does not have Bluetooth but Wi-Fi.Will Kelly from Techrepublic wrote a tutorial on how to send files from Android to iOS: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/smartphones/send-files-between-android-and-ios-with-fast-file-transfer/6097Simply tap "Share via" in any file exlorer or in the gallery app, choose this app and follow the on-screen instructions.How to send multiple files?Just select multiple files in your file explorer and tap "Send via" (or similar) -> "Fast File Transfer"In some file explorers first tap "Send via" in the menu, choose this app and then your files.I don\'t want to always enter the address on the receiver\'s phone!Use the built-in QR codes orSave a bookmark:Send multiple files once and add a bookmark to the file index page in your web browser. Later just open this bookmark to receive files.Where can I change the password and username?Open the app from the launcher. The instruction screen will appear. Now press the menu button and choose "Settings".PLEASE NOTE:This app might not run on some phones due to restrictions of manufacturers or carriers that make it impossible for the app to access WiFi tethering.Please don\'t write bad reviews because of this fact, unfortunately I cannot do anything against it. Please don\'t write 3-star reviews mentioning the app did not work on your device. 3-star-reviews influence the overall rating as well.!!! PLEASE CONTACT ME VIA THE "EMAIL DEVELOPER" LINK INSTEAD OF WRITING BAD REVIEWS IF YOU EXPERIENCE BUGS !!!! The app does not work on:Motorola Razr XT910 (Restarts phone; Problem in Motorola\'s Android implementation)Motorola Razr XT890HTC One XHTC One SHTC EVO 3D X515mSome Galaxy Y devicesDevices that don\'t have WiFi Tethering setting, such as the Nexus 7The transfer speed this app offers depends on the sender and receiver device. The highest value I measured is 33 Mbit/s which means 1 GB in under 5 minutes.This app uses zxing (http://code.google.com/p/zxing/) for QR code generation.Although I have never experienced such a case, I do not guarantee for any data fees caused by this app.THIS APP IS NO SPAM:There is one review claiming that the app junks your phone with spam. This is by no way true. I already tried to contact the author of this review, but am unfortunately unable to answer to reviews.If you want to support me, please help me get rid of this FALSE review, and mark the review as spam.Recent changes:\xe2\x80\xa2 NFC (Beta)For connecting to WiFi and opening web addressInstall an app like WiFiTap on the receipient\'s device for connecting to the WiFi via NFCPlease note that WiFiTap won\'t connect to already known WiFisSend me an email if you experience problems\xe2\x80\xa2 New notifications for progress, file size, transfer speed and estimated transfer time\xe2\x80\xa2 Hints for QR code and NFC\xe2\x80\xa2 Supports Android 2.2 (tested on ZTE Blade)\xe2\x80\xa2 Continues sending when screen is off or app is closed to background\xe2\x80\xa2 Bug fixes'
