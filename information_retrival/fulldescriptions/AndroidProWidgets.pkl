The main app is mainly intended for explaining how to actually add widgets to your home screen.[2] A scroll button is used on Android 2.x with launchers that don't support scrollable widgets. If your launcher does not support scrolling either use the scroll button or replace your launcher. Honeycomb, ICS, JB, ADW Launcher, Launcher Pro, Go Launcher Ex and many other launchers support scrollable widgets.[3] Calendar widget is not scrollable in its grid mode.[4] In Quick Event entering the edit window will ignore the reminder setting and the selected calendar, and use the default calendar application settings instead.[5] Bookmarks widget supports the following browsers: Stock, Chrome, MIUI, Skyfire. Please understand that most browsers simply can't be supported.[6] Facebook/Twitter pictures are cached to SD card. Clear cache in preferences if the pictures are outdated.[7] On Android 4.x the Facebook for Android application does not normally allow non system applications to access contact images. Use the free Facebook contact Sync application http://goo.gl/Jw8W7[8] Reasons for every permission are available here http://androidprowidgets.blogspot.com/p/android-permissions.html** apw, widget, widgets package, widgets pack, scrollable, scrolling, calendar, agenda widget, quickadd, people widget, contacts widget, bookmarks widget, messaging widget, sms widget, facebook widget, twitter widget, honeycomb, ics, ice cream sandwitch **Recent changes:Fixed compatibility with Chrome browser"
