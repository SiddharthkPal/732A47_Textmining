S'eBroselow\xe2\x80\x99s SafeDose app takes the math out of medicine. It provides emergency rooms, pharmacies and EMS with clinical content and tracking features that eliminate math and extra steps in drug administration and acute care. This improves medication safety, reduces the cost of care, and improves clinical outcomes. In an emergency setting, proper drug mixing and dilution, proper drug administration and proper dose in mL to a patient is critically time-sensitive. SafeDose provides the correct clinical information for hundreds of acute care and other drugs in seconds. First responders and EMS staff can use SafeDose to log patient status, drug administrations and caregiver actions. The SafeDose \xe2\x80\x9cphoto feature\xe2\x80\x9d can record time-stamped pictures of the patient, instrument settings and accident scene. SafeDose gives Nurses the exact dose in mL to avoid the ten-fold dosing errors that can lead to "death by decimal point." Doctors can use SafeDose to order medications and send administration instructions to nurses and pharmacists. SafeDose creates a tidy PDF document that can be emailed as an order or prescription. Pharmacists get precise mixing instructions and can receive emailed PDF orders from doctors. This is a much safer and more efficient process than handwriting and paper. An amazing new \xe2\x80\x9cNDC number and barcode scanning feature\xe2\x80\x9d allows nurses and pharmacists to quickly enter the NDC number for any drug with an FDA NDC number on it (all drugs in the US). Entering this number, taking a picture of the barcode with the mobile device\xe2\x80\x99s camera, or scanning the barcode label with a Bluetooth scanner immediately brings up the dose in mL. iMedicalApps said SafeDose is "useful and well designed... Undoubtedly, the potential for medication errors would be reduced if practitioners were to rely on the information provided by this app".
